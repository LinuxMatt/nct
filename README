Welcome to N Colored Tetris!


This game was originally written by me in i86 assembly language for DOS, and
the binary was just 1940 bytes. I was second year student, it was 1993.

Some time later (in 1995) I decided to rewrite it in C for unix. I used my
own interface library that tried to work on both unix and dos. The game
actually worked that time, but I had not finished scoring.

Now (1998) I remembered that unfinished game and decided to rewrite it using
ncurses library and publish it under GNU GPL.


The game is similar to famous Tetris game (by A. Pajitnov & V. Gerasimov),
but is extended by color, which has its function. The number of colors can
be changed, and in the case of 1 color we get the original Tetris game.

The colors are ordered by weights assigned to them. More heavy colors can
replace more light ones. Full lines of the same color disappear.


Scores are separate for each number of colors. For each figure a number of
points are added, minus number of lines it falled for itself and minus 5
points for seeing the next figure. For full lines of light colors extra
bonus is added.


Keys are:
   j, 7, left, home    -   move left
   k, 8, up            -   rotate
   l, 9, right, pgup   -   move right
   space, 0, down      -   drop
   1                   -   next figure
   q                   -   quit
   p                   -   pause


As usual, there is no warranty. That would be _your_ keyboard you break :)


Have fun!
